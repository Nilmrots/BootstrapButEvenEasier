# Bootstrap but Even Easier

Make a website without any HTML knowledge. Just write a text file with what you want on the website, run the Python file, and you have a Bootstrap website. This project was made based on the Bootstrap template "Freelancer".

## How to format the request.txt file

Write your website's title on the first line.

Skip a line, then write the names of your section headings on consecutive lines.

Skip a line, then write the name of the image file you want to appear at the top of your website.
(Make sure you also put the image file in the same folder as index.html before running the website.)

Skip a line, then write the big title text that you want below the image .

Skip a line, then write any number of lines to be in smaller text below the large text.
(If you want a line break, use "\n".)

Skip a line, then write any number of lines to be in the body of the first section.

Skip a line, then write the section section, and continue doing this until you are done with all of the sections.
